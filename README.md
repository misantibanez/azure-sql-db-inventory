## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues, here are some common solutions:

1. **Error: "Unable to authenticate"**
   - Ensure you've run `az login` and that you have the necessary permissions for the subscription.

2. **Error: "Command not found"**
   - Make sure you've installed the Azure CLI and are running the script in the correct environment (Bash or PowerShell).
